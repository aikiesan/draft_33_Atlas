    'Running since June 1991, Curitiba''s Green Exchange (Câmbio Verde) enables any citizen to exchange recyclable materials (paper, cardboard, glass, metals, used cooking oil) for fresh fruits and vegetables without registration. Every 4kg recyclables = 1kg produce. Monthly collection: 290 tons recyclables + 3,500 liters cooking oil diverted from incorrect disposal becoming food on tables. By 2007, recovered 45,000+ tons from landfills. Special Green Exchange operates city-wide in schools. Program employs ~600 workers. Guarantees sale of surplus crop production from small farmers while making fresh produce accessible/affordable for low-income residents in areas without conventional waste collection. Won 2010 Globe Sustainable City Award for excellence in sustainable urban development. Addresses multiple SDGs simultaneously: waste management, food security, poverty, farmer livelihoods, environmental education.',
