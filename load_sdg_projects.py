Before program, residents collected rainwater with makeshift systems filtered through cotton cloths or bought water from tanker trucks (pipas) carrying in jerry cans. RHS consists of receptacle 'Tlaloc' (named after Aztec rain god) filtering dust before water runs into 5,000-liter tank distributed to local network.
